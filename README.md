# Follow-Array-Number-Position-2023
A simple Python program in Bulgarian I created in university for entering a series of numbers, picking a number and checking its position after the series of numbers is shuffled.
# Features
1. The user is prompted to enter a series of integer numbers, divided by ", ", which get stored as an array.
2. The user is prompted to enter a number contained in the array.
3. If the user enters a number that isn't an integer or is not contained in the array, an error message is shown.
4. A list is used to store the numbers in the array before shuffling and the list is printed.
5. The chosen number's position is printed.
6. The array is shuffled.
7. A list is used to store the numbers in the array after shuffling and the list is printed.
8. The chosen number's position in the shuffled array list is printed.
